# RSS Listen
## project
RSS Listen is a project that uses AI to facilitate research into previously difficult media to analyse such as Podcasts or YouTube videos, by enabling transcription at scale.

Users provide media delivered by an RSS Feed and RSS Listen will transcribe the entire feed.

Transcripts can then be analysed using existing techniques from corpus linguistics or content analysis.
